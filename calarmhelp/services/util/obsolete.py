This transformation must consider `{current_time}`, the current time in 'America/New_York' timezone, to validate the event's timing. Use the tool `create_alarm_readout` to finalize the processing of event details. The expected output is a Python dictionary with the following structure:

1. Ensure that the event described in `{user_input}` is in the future relative to `{current_time}`. If the event is in the past, set 'error' to True.
2. Construct the event details into a dictionary, adhering to the specified schema:
    - name: The name of the event.
    - category: The category of the event, inferred from the input or defaulted to 'General'.
    - lead_time: The reminder lead time in minutes. If unspecified, default to 30 minutes.
    - event_time: The start time of the event, in 'America/New_York' timezone.
    - event_time_end: The end time of the event, also in 'America/New_York' timezone.
    - location: The location of the event, if provided.
    - error: A boolean flag indicating if there was an error in processing.
    - current_time: The current time, provided as `{current_time}`, in 'America/New_York' timezone.
3. Process the initial input or the structured dictionary through the tool `create_alarm_readout`.
4. Output the final response as a Python dictionary in the following format:

Most of the time this should be an empty string. Location callouts are rare.), and an 'error' (boolean, only ever true if llm fails). Your JSON response will only have the fields 'name', 'category', 'lead_time' (always expressed in terms of minutes. So 3 hours = 180 for example - and if lead_time is not specified, defaults to 30), event_time_end, event_time', 'creation_time' (datetime object), 'location', and 'error'. Always use double quotes for keys and values in the JSON object you create.
        Do not create events that are in the past. If a time is given, say 8AM but the current time is 9AM - assume the time given is for the future. Also, look for language that indicates when - and pair that with time to produce the correct date.

Your output should be organized into a Python dictionary named `event_details`, which you will then process with `create_alarm_readout`.

Follow these steps:

1. Check if `{user_input}` describes a future event relative to `{current_time}`. If not, flag the event as an error.
2. Populate the dictionary with the information extracted from `{user_input}` and `{current_time}`, following the specified schema.
3. Remember to set the timezone for `event_time`, `event_time_end`, and `current_time` to 'America/New_York'.
4. If critical information is missing or if an error is detected during validation (e.g., event date in the past), ensure to flag the event appropriately.
